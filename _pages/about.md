Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD candidate from College of Economics and Management in [China Agriculture University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/).My PhD project is fund by [Sino-Dutch Agriculture Green Development Program](). In the project, I am supervised by Prof. Dr. [Wei Si](http://cem.cau.edu.cn/art/2020/3/24/art_34695_133.html) and Prof. Dr. [Weifeng Zhang](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/zwf/) from China Agriculture University as well as Prof. Dr.[Nico Heerink](https://www.wur.nl/nl/personen/nico-heerink.htm), and Dr. [Fan Li](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/fan-li.htm) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/). 
With over 7+ years of experience as a researcher and economist, I specialise in policy evaluation and environmental impact assessment. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modelling approaches to explore mitigation pathways for sustainable food systems.Dissertation on exploring the policy design to address environment issue through technology and institution innovation based on the insight from straw-burning management in China. 
In my **Job Market Paper** ([Main Text](assets/20240520_Food waste paper_Weitong Long.pdf); [Supplementary information](assets/20240520_Supplementary information_Food waste paper_Weitong Long.pdf); [Slides](assets/20240703_Food waste slides_Weitong Long.pdf)), I discussed the asymmetric impacts of feeding China‚Äôs monogastric livestock with food waste on food security and environment sustainability.

**I am expected to receive my PhD in September 2025. Currently, I am seeking academic opportunities for the 2024-2025 academic year. I am available for interviews at both the [European Job Market (EJME)](https://www.europeanjobmarketofeconomists.org/) and the [Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA)](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/).**
