In the project, I am supervised by Prof. Dr. [Wei Si](http://cem.cau.edu.cn/art/2020/3/24/art_34695_133.html) and Prof. Dr. [Weifeng Zhang](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/zwf/) from China Agriculture University as well as Prof. Dr.[Nico Heerink](https://www.wur.nl/nl/personen/nico-heerink.htm), and Dr. [Fan Li](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/fan-li.htm) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/). 
With over 7+ years of experience as a researcher and economist, I specialise in policy evaluation and environmental impact assessment. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modelling approaches to explore mitigation pathways for sustainable food systems.Dissertation on exploring the policy design to address environment issue through technology and institution innovation based on the insight from straw-burning management in China.
