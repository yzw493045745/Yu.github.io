Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD from the College of Economics and Management in [China Agriculture University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/). My PhD project is funded by [Sino-Dutch Agriculture Green Development Program](https://www.wur.nl/en/education-programmes/phd-programme/agd-phd-program.htm). In the project, I am supervised by Prof. Dr. [Wei Si](http://cem.cau.edu.cn/art/2020/3/24/art_34695_133.html) and Prof. Dr. [Weifeng Zhang](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/zwf/) from China Agriculture University, as well as Prof. Dr.[Nico Heerink](https://www.wur.nl/nl/personen/nico-heerink.htm), and Dr. [Fan Li](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/fan-li.htm) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/). 
With over 7+ years of experience as a researcher and economist, I specialize in policy evaluation and environmental impact assessment. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modeling approaches to explore mitigation pathways for sustainable food systems. Dissertation on exploring the policy design to address environmental issues through technology and institutional innovation based on the insight from straw-burning management in China.
